## Getting started

You can view a live demo over at https://maxmax.github.io/authapp/index.html

To get the frontend running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `yarn install` to install all req'd dependencies
- `yarn start` to start the local server (this project uses create-react-app)


### Making requests to the backend API

For convenience, we have a live API server running at https://heroku-indev-.io/api for the application to make requests against. You can view [the API spec here](https://github.com/-indev-/master/api) which contains all routes & responses for the server.
