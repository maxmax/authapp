## Getting started

You can view a live demo over at [Demo](https://maxmax.github.io/authapp/index.html)

Get the frontend running:

- Clone this repo
- `yarn install` to install all req'd dependencies
- `yarn start` to start the local server (this project uses create-react-app)


### Making requests to the backend API
For convenience, we have a live API server running at https://morning-ridge-81350.herokuapp.com/api for the application to make requests against. You can view [the API spec here](https://github.com/maxmax/nodeback) which contains all routes & responses for the server.
